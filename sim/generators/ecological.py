"""
This code is meant to create tables with simple (ecologically based)
relationships between OTUs to test if the tools can accurately recapture
relationships that are defined by a mechanism rather than by a high
correlation score. The reason we chose this method is because we want a way to
assess if relationships we know to exist in biological contexts can be revealed
through co-occurrence analysis as is frequently reported.

All interactions are linear and dependent on OTU abundance
0 = no effect, - = negative effect, + = positive effect
OTU1    OTU2    INTERACTION TYPE
 0       0        Neutralism
 0       -        Amensalism
 0       +        Commensalism
 +       +        Mutualism
 +       -        Parasatism
 -       -        Competition

The things that have a '_1d' in them are meant to operate on two otus. The
functions which have '_nd' operate on any number of otus where the last otu
is akin to otu2 and the preceeding otus are a network that collectively
represent otu 1. otus should be 1xn arrays or mxn arrays where m is the number
of otus and n is the number of samples (like a normal qiime otu table).

Some interaction types not covered by the above are implemented including
obligate syntrophy (dependence of OTU2 on OTU1's presence) and ...
